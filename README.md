## Introduction

Welcome to the Webots-Projects repository, a collection of robotics projects developed using Webots, a comprehensive simulation platform used in robotics research and education. This repository aims to provide a diverse set of examples to demonstrate different robotic behaviors, from simple Braitenberg vehicles to complex wall-following robots. Each project is designed to help users understand and implement robotic principles in a simulated environment, making it an excellent resource for students, educators, and researchers.

## Project Files

### 1. Braitenberg Vehicles Webots Tutorial

**Description:**
This project simulates Braitenberg vehicles, simple autonomous robots inspired by biological organisms. These vehicles demonstrate basic behaviors such as light-seeking or light-avoiding using minimal sensors and actuators. The prototype used in this project is a four-wheel robot, which can be easily modified to exhibit various Braitenberg behaviors.

**Files:**
- `FourWheelRobot.proto`: Defines the structure and behavior of the four-wheel Braitenberg vehicle.

### 2. Line Follower Webots Tutorial

**Description:**
The Line Follower project features a robot designed to follow a predefined path or line. The robot is equipped with sensors to detect the line and motors to adjust its movement, ensuring it stays on track. This type of robot is commonly used in educational robotics to teach concepts of sensor integration and control systems.

**Files:**
- `TrackOne.proto`: Contains the definition for the track and the robot used for the line-following task.

### 3. Custom Differential Drive Robot with Eyes

**Description:**
This project introduces a custom differential drive robot equipped with eye-shaped sensors. The robot features two independently driven wheels, allowing for precise maneuverability. The eyes add a unique aesthetic and functional aspect, making the robot suitable for tasks that require obstacle detection and navigation.

**Files:**
- `DiffDriveRobotWithEyes.proto`: Describes the differential drive robot with detailed specifications and sensor configurations.

### 4. Wall Follower Webots Tutorial

**Description:**
The Wall Follower project focuses on a robot designed to navigate through a maze by following walls. Using distance sensors, the robot can detect and follow walls, making decisions at intersections to find its way through the maze. This project is ideal for learning about autonomous navigation and sensor-based decision-making.

**Files:**
- `WorldMaze.proto`: Defines the maze environment and the robot‚Äôs parameters for wall-following navigation.
